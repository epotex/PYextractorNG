# PYextractorNG
I got tired extracting my archives manually :)

make sure you run "(sudo) pip install -r requirements.txt " first to install the python "patool" and "pyunpack" modules.

two important configurations to set: 
1. 'root = "/" ' the folder where the scan start.
2. 'extract_path = "/tmp/"' the folder where the archive will be extracted to.
